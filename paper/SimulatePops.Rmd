% Authors
% 2013


# Introduction

- Need of simulation testing for evaluating non-linear complex models, e.g. stcok assessment models

- Previous work

# Methods

## Building simulated fish populations [IM]

- gislasim()

## Projection under different scenarios [IM]

## Simulation grid [CO]

## Variability and uncertainty [CM, JT]

## Application and implementation [CM, IM]

# Results

## Characteristics of the simulated population trajectories

# Comparisons across scenarios
- Comparative plots of population trajectories [CO]

# Code repository & example use [IM]

# Discussion

* Highlight generality of using LH-based relationships, they could exist in other taxa and general framework could be adapted.
